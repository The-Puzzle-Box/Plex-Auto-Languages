# Plex Auto Languages

Plex Auto Languages enhances your Plex experience by automatically updating the audio and subtitle settings of TV shows based on your preferences. Similar to Netflix, it remembers your language settings for each TV show without interfering with your global settings or other users' preferences.

## Features

- **Seamless Language Selection**:
  Watch *Squid Game* in Korean with English subtitles? Set it once for the first episode and enjoy the rest of the series hassle-free. 👌

- **Per-Show Customization**:
  Want *The Mandalorian* in English and *Game of Thrones* in French? Preferences are tracked separately for each show. ✔️

- **Multi-User Support**:
  Perfect for households with diverse preferences. Each user gets their tracks automatically and independently selected. ✔️

## Getting Started

### Requirements

To use Plex Auto Languages, you'll need:

1. **Plex Token**:
   Learn how to retrieve yours from the [official Plex guide](https://support.plex.tv/articles/204059436-finding-an-authentication-token-x-plex-token/).

2. **Python 3.8+** or **Docker**:
   The application can run natively via Python or as a Docker container.

### Installation Options

#### Docker Installation

Running Plex Auto Languages with Docker is the recommended approach.

**Docker Image Tags:**

- **`main` (Development)**:
  Tracks the latest commit on the main branch. Includes the newest features but may be unstable.

  *Recommended for*: Developers and testers.

  *Note*: Updates with every commit; may include breaking changes.

- **`latest` (Stable Release)**:
  Points to the most recent stable release. Ideal for production environments.

  *Recommended for*: General use.

- **`A.B.C.D` (Versioned Releases)**:
  Specific version tags for consistency and reliability.

  *Recommended for*: Environments requiring strict version control.

**Docker Registries:**

The Docker image can be pulled from either of the following registries:
- `ghcr.io/journeydocker/plex-auto-languages:<tagname>`
- `journeyover/plex-auto-languages:<tagname>`

**Docker Compose Configuration:**

Here's an example of a minimal `docker-compose.yml` setup:

```yaml
services:
  plexautolanguages:
    image: journeyover/plex-auto-languages:latest
    environment:
      - PLEX_URL=http://plex:32400
      - PLEX_TOKEN=MY_PLEX_TOKEN
      - TZ=Europe/Paris
    volumes:
      - ./config:/config
```

**Run with Docker CLI:**

Alternatively, you can run the container directly:

```bash
docker run -d \
  -e PLEX_URL=http://plex:32400 \
  -e PLEX_TOKEN=MY_PLEX_TOKEN \
  -e TZ=Europe/Paris \
  -v ./config:/config \
  journeyover/plex-auto-languages:latest
```

-----

#### Python Installation

Follow these steps for a native Python setup:

1.  **Clone the Repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/JourneyDocker/Plex-Auto-Languages.git
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**:

    ```bash
    cd Plex-Auto-Languages
    python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Create Configuration File**:

    Use the template in the [default configuration file](https://github.com/JourneyDocker/Plex-Auto-Languages/blob/main/config.example.yaml) to create your own `config.yaml`. Only `plex.url` and `plex.token` are required.

4.  **Run the Application**:

    ```bash
    python main.py -c ./config.yaml
    ```

-----

#### Windows Installation

Follow these steps to run on Windows OS

1. **Download the latest "PlexAutoLanguages.exe" binary from the releases page**:
  
    Find the latest release here. https://github.com/The-Puzzle-Box/Plex-Auto-Languages/releases

2. **Create a folder wherever you would like the file to live**: 
    
    Recommended location is '/%userprofile%/"Plex Auto Languages"/'

3. **Run the `PlexAutoLanguages.exe` Application**

    Double click on `PlexAutoLanguages.exe" to run the file.
    
    **Note:** The `PlexAutoLanguages.exe` will create default `config.example.yaml` and `./logs/plex_auto_languages.txt` file in the same folder you place the `exe` file when it is first run.

4. **Create Configuration File**
    If you did not create a user configuration file before running the `exe`. Use the [default configuration file](config.example.yaml) created in the folder. 

    **(Optional)** Before running the first time. Use the template in the [default configuration file](https://github.com/The-Puzzle-Box/Plex-Auto-Languages/blob/main/config/config.example.yaml) to create your own `config.yaml` and place in the folder you place the `exe` file. Only `plex.url` and `plex.token` are required. Rename the `config.example.yaml` to `config.yaml` before running the `exe`.

5. **Run the Application**

    Double click on `PlexAutoLanguages.exe" to run the file.

**Note: If you would like to install the Application as a Windows Service. You can use a service manager application like Servy or NSSM. Servy is recommended as it has more features and is actively developed, unlike NSSM.**

### How to Update

#### Updating Docker

If you are running the Docker container, update to the latest version by pulling the new image and recreating your container:

1.  **Pull the latest image**:
    ```bash
    docker pull journeyover/plex-auto-languages:latest
    ```
2.  **Recreate the container**: Stop your current container and start it again using your existing `docker-compose up -d` or `docker run` command.

#### Updating Python

To update a native Python installation to the latest version:

1.  **Pull the latest changes**:

    ```bash
    git pull
    ```

2.  **Update dependencies** (if requirements.txt has changed):

    ```bash
    python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Review your configuration**:
    Compare your `config.yaml` with the latest [config.example.yaml](https://github.com/JourneyDocker/Plex-Auto-Languages/blob/main/config.example.yaml) and add any new settings as needed.

4.  **Restart the application**:
    Restart PAL with your updated code and configuration.

If you're migrating from an older version, consider backing up your config and following the installation steps from scratch.

## Configuration

The application can be configured using either:

  - **Environment Variables**
  - **YAML File** (mounted at `/config/config.yaml`; see [config.example.yaml](https://github.com/JourneyDocker/Plex-Auto-Languages/blob/main/config.example.yaml) for example config)
